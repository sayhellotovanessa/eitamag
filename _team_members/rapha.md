He illustrated, scripted, and lettered various stories for independent publication in Brazil, United States and Portugal. Raphael is a recurrent collaborator at Tempos Fantásticos, where he is responsible for part of the graphic language. He loves coffee, cachaça with honey, naps, whimsical projects and public transportation.
