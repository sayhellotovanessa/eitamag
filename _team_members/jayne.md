**Managing editor, editorial wrangler, calendar master.**

Journalist and editorial producer. She pays the bills working with science journalism and, in her free time, she keeps herself busy with parallel projects and watches Friends over and over again. Jayne lives in SÃ£o Paulo, drinks way too much coffee and can't wait to live in a cabin in the woods, like the witches in the stories she read as a child.
