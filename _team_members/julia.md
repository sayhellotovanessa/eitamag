### Júlia Serrano

**Translator, Copy editor, Social Media Fairy, Humble Scholar 's Apprentice, Queluziana, Chihuahua Tamer, Jane of All Trades.**

Júlia has been rummaging the world in search of word-centric work—such as a translator (EN-PT), proofreader, copyeditor and Game master in a long-running RPG campaign. Born in Recife and raised in between Olinda and the state capital, she's now on her way to a master's degree in Translation Studies, and in her spare time, Júlia writes fun things she does not yet have the courage to try to publish.
