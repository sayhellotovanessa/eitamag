**Founding editor, Translator, Copy editor, Our Lady of Deadlines, Master of words, Manager of the Eita Anarchy.**

Iana is a translator-interpreter (EN-PT) based in Recife, Brazil. She also works for publishing houses as a copy editor and proofreader, while trying to write some weird stuff and slipstream nonsense. Her work has been published in some Brazilian zines, such as Faísca Mafagafo, Pio and Trasgo (to be released). She is an editor at Pretérita Revista, a magazine focused on Brazilian historical fiction. Iana is usually found surrounded by cats and a pile of to-be-read books.
