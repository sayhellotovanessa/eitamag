You can support Eita! on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/EitaMagSFF)! You can **become a Patreon** for as little as $1 per issue and you’ll already be a part of our very cool Discord channel. Check out the different options with a diverse set of tiers so you can choose the most suitable for you!

You also have the option to buy our issues on Amazon(link), but just so you know we release it first to our Patreons (with format options depending on the tier of choice), and the price per issue on Amazon is set at $ 4,99. However, if you choose to be our recurring patron, you can get each issue for only $4!

Whatever you choose ***we thank you*** for the support!
