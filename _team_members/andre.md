**Slush reader, copy editor, translator, grim marketer, jack of all trades, master of none.**

Public servant by day, nerd by all hours. Based on Santo André, near São Paulo, Brazil. He’d been trying to become a writer for years, but only found mild success when he resorted to extreme measures and actually wrote something. He doesn’t know what Facebook is.
