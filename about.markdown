1. **What is Eita! Magazine?**

    Eita! is a magazine created to promote Brazilian science fiction and fantasy to a foreign audience, revealing the tendencies of our national SFF works and to insert Brazilian production in the worldwide cultural discussion.

2. **Why is Eita! neccessary?**

    We have a LOT of Brazilian stories to tell, so instead of waiting for someone to translate, recognize and accept our work in the very competitive market of anglophone zines, weâ€™re creating our own space.

3. **What do we expect?**

    We hope to become a bridge to release national authors to the international literary market, encouraging consumption of Brazilian genre literature by an overseas audience.

4. **What is our mission?**

    To serve as the main channel and as a reference of our content.

5. **What is our vision?**

    To create spaces in the English-speaking market for Brazilian SFF writers.
